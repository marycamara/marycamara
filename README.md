### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mary, a graduate student based in London, United Kingdom. Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my skills in full-stack development.

When I'm not coding, I'm deeply intrigued by the latest scientific developments and enjoy staying updated on breakthroughs in various fields. On weekends, I like to explore the beautiful landscapes of London through my passion for running.

Feel free to reach out to me via email at [Email](mailto:marycamara101@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marycamara/).
